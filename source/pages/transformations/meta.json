	"title": "What is an affine transformation?",
	"description": "An affine transformation is any transformation that preserves collinearity (i.e., all points lying on a line initially still lie on a line after transformation) and ratios of distances (e.g., the midpoint of a line segment remains the midpoint after transformation). In this sense, affine indicates a special class of projective transformations that do not move any objects from the affine space R^3 to the plane at infinity or conversely. An affine transformation is also called an affinity. While an affine transformation preserves proportions on lines, it does not necessarily preserve angles or lengths. Any triangle can be transformed into any other by an affine transformation, so all triangles are affine and, in this sense, affine is a generalization of congruent and similar."
