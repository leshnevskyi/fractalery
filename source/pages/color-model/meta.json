	"description": "A color model is a system that uses three primary colors to create a larger range of colors. There are different kinds of color models used for different purposes, and each has a slightly different range of colors they can produce. The whole range of colors that a specific type of color model produces is called a color space. All color results from how our eye processes light waves, but depending on the type of media, creating that color comes from different methods. The RGB color model is an additive color model in which the red, green and blue primary colors of light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors, red, green, and blue. The Hue, Saturation, Lightness system was developed decades ago as a way to evolve the RGB color system by making it easier to visualize."
