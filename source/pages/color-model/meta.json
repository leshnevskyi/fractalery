	"description": "A color model is a system that uses three primary colors to create a larger range of colors. There are different kinds of color models used for different purposes, and each has a slightly different range of colors they can produce. The whole range of colors that a specific type of color model produces is called a color space. All color results from how our eye processes light waves, but depending on the type of media, creating that color comes from different methods."
